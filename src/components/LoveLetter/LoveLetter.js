      <p><strong>Dear Leona</strong> (shoona, baby, loml, sweetheart, etc...🖤),</p>
      <p>It's been almost a year since we started talking (crazy, right? haha). I'd like to say that I'm glad I met you. I feel amazing every time we hang out. Even when we don't see each other, I enjoy every moment. Your voice, laugh, smile, and beautiful face always make me happy.</p>
      <p>I'm grateful that you've put up with and supported me so many times when I'm moody, sad, or anxious about things like my parents or life. I wanted to tell you how much you mean to me. Being with you makes me happy, and I hope we end up together for those 84 years we promised!</p>
      <p>You are special to me, so don't worry about "us not working out during college" because only time will tell. Let's focus on the present and enjoy the time we have together. We're together now, and I love you so much. If anyone ever tries to flirt with you (guy or girl), you should just, like, shoot and kill them (kidding, of course!).</p>
      <p>I can see our dynamic working out in a way that ends with us being together for a long time. I like being with you, our fun late escapades, being skin-to-skin close to you, and our getting big sessions. Never have I been so blessed as to fall in love with someone as wonderful as you.</p>
      <p><em>Āmi tōmākē bhālōbāsi</em></p>
      <p>Always yours,<br />
      - Richie</p>
